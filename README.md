### Demo
Open [Demo](https://maryna-dumenko.github.io/date-calculator/) to view it.

### The web page contains 2 tabs:
1. On the first tab, the user can select a date in the first input, then a date in the second input, or use preset for interval and set additional parameters - and get the time interval between these dates. The last 10 calculation results are displayed in the table and also saved to localStorage.
2. On the second tab, the user can select the country in the first input, then the year in the second input - and get a list of holidays with dates. For the 'Date' column, there is a clickable button on which the user can sort the holidays by date.
